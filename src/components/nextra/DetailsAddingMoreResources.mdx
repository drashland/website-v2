<p className="nx-mt-6 px-5 nx-leading-7">In case you need to add more resources to your chain, you can do so in the same way shown above &mdash; you create a resource class and add it to your chain using `chain.resources()`.</p>
<p className="nx-mt-6 px-5 nx-leading-7">Taking the above code as an example, if you wrote `Users` and `Orders` resource classes and wanted to add them, it would look like:</p>
<div className="nx-mt-6 px-5">
```ts {5-6}
const chain = Chain
  .builder()                    // Get the chain's builder so we can build the chain easily.
  .resources(
    Home,                       // Add the `Home` resource to the chain.
    Users,                      // Add the `Users` resource to the chain.
    Orders,                     // Add the `Orders` resource to the chain.
  )
  .build();                     // Build the chain.
```
</div>
