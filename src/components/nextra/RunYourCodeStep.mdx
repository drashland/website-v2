### Run Your Code

You will need to __run your code__ before you can verify it works. Please refer to your chosen runtime's documentation pages for instructions on running the above `app.ts` file (or `app.js` file if you are using JavaScript).

<div className="nx-mt-6 px-5">
```bash filename="Terminal"
deno run --alow-net app.ts
```
</div>

__Tip:__ You might notice runtime documentation pages show their __latest__ stable version's pages. Before reading documentation, we suggest you __confirm the pages you are reading are for the version you are using__. For example, if you are using Bun v.0x, then make sure you are reading Bun v0.x documentation, not v1.x or later.
