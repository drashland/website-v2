### Run Your Code

You will need to run your code before you can verify it works. Please refer to your chosen runtime's documentation pages for instructions on running the above `app.ts` file (or `app.js` file if you are using JavaScript).

<CalloutSilent>
__Tip:__ You will notice runtime documentation pages default to showing their __latest__ stable version's pages. Before reading documentation, we suggest you confirm the pages you are reading are written for the runtime version you are using. For example, if you are using Bun v.0x, then make sure you are reading Bun v0.x documentation.
