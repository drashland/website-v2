# Migration Guide to v2

Below are sections pertaining to parts of Drash that have changed. There are
example code blocks highlighted similarly to Git diffs. The `-` red lines are
what was removed and the `+` green lines are what was added. The `+` green lines
are what your Drash application should be using if migrating from v1 to v2.

## Drash Namespace

Changes:

- `Drash` is not the only exported member.

  ```diff-typescript
  - import { Drash } from "...";
  + import * as Drash from "...";
  ```

- You can `import` parts of the `Drash` namespace like so:

  ```typescript
  import {
    Resource,
    Request,
    Response,
    ... other members
  } from "...";
  ```

## Resources

Changes:

- `Http` namespace has been removed.

  ```diff-typescript
  - class MyResource extends Drash.Http.Resource {
  + class MyResource extends Drash.Resource {
  ```

- `paths` property is now `public`.

  ```diff-typescript
  - static paths = ["/:some_param"];
  + public paths = ["/:some_param"];
  ```

- HTTP methods now require `request` and `response` parameters; and
  `this.request` and `this.response` are no longer available. This change goes
  against Drash's original philosophy that `this.request` and `this.response`
  should be readily available, but having `this` in resources seemed to be too
  "magical," and it was decided to have them removed and turned into required
  parameters.

  ```diff-typescript
  - public GET(): Drash.Response {
  + public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
  ```

  Also, with the above change, HTTP methods do not return a `response` object.
  They now return `void`.

- Methods to get parameters off the `request` object have changed.

  ```diff-typescript
  // Get path params from the URI
  - const pathParam = this.request.getPathParam("some_param");
  + const pathParam = request.pathParam("some_param");

    // Getting body params (works for form-urlencoded and JSON)
  - const bodyParam = this.request.getBodyParam("something")
  + const bodyParam = request.bodyParam<T>("something"); // T should match the type of the request's body

    // Getting files using multipart/form-data
  - const bodyFile = this.request.getBodyFile("file_name");
  + const bodyFile = request.bodyParam<BodyFile[]>("file_name");

    // Getting URL query params
  - const queryParam = this.request.getUrlQueryParam("some_param");
  + const queryParam = request.queryParam("some_param");
  ```

- `this.response.body` and `return this.response` can no longer be used. To set
  a body on the `response` object, you can call one of the `response` object's
  body methods to set the response body and `return` on the same line. You can
  learn more about the `response` object's body methods at
  [Tutorials > Responses > Setting the Body](/drash/v2.x/tutorials/responses/setting-the-body).
  The `response` object's body methods return `void`.

  ```diff-typescript
  - this.response.body = "Hello, world!";
  - return this.response;
  + return response.text("Hello, world!");
    // or return response.json( ... );
    // or return response.xml( ... );
    // or return response.html( ... );
    // or return response.file( ... );
    // or return response.download( ... );
    // or return response.render( ... );
    // or return response.send<T>("some-content-type, body); // T should match the body's type
  ```

## Middleware

Drash v2 uses the term "services" to encapsulate any software used in a Drash
application that is not part of Drash's core functionality. This includes
middleware. In Drash v1, the term "middleware" is used. During the course of v1
maintenance, it was found that the term "middleware" was restrictive about what
kind of software could be plugged into a Drash application. Therefore, the term
was changed to "services" to create a broader scope.

When using services, there are quite a few differences:

- `import` statements have changed
- Decorators have been removed from resource-level services and a
  `tsconfig.json` file is not required
- All services must follow the new `Drash.Service` syntax (see
  [Tutorials > Services > Creating Services](/drash/v2.x/tutorials/services/creating-services/introduction))

You can learn more about using Drash services in the left sidebar under
Tutorials > Services.

### Importing

In v1, you use the `deno-drash-middleware` repository to import middleware. In
v2, you use the `deno-drash` repository's `services.ts` file like so:

```diff-typescript
- import SomeMiddleware from "http://deno.land/x/deno-drash-middleware/some_middleware/mod.ts";
+ import { SomeMiddleware } from "http://deno.land/x/drash/services.ts";
```

### Resource-Level

Resource-level middleware in Drash v1 requires a `tsconfig.json` file with
`experimentalDecorators` set to `true`. In Drash v2, decorators were removed so
you do not need a `tsconfig.json` file (unless you use one for something other
than Drash).

```diff-typescript
// tsconfig.json

- {
-   "compilerOptions": {
-     "experimentalDecorators": true
-   }
- }
```

To use a service in your resource, change to the following:

```diff-typescript
// some_resource.ts

- @Drash.Http.Middleware({
-   before_request: [ SomethingA ],
-   after_request: [ SomethingB ],
- })
- export default class SomeResource extends Drash.Http.Resource {
+ export default class SomeResource extends Drash.Resource {

    // All services that used to be in decorators now go into this property
    // To learn more about this property, view Tutorials > Services > Resource-Level Services
+   public services = {
+     ALL: [
+       SomethingA,
+       SomethingB,
+     ],
+     GET: [
+       SomethingC,
+       SomethingD,
+     ],
+   };

-   @Drash.Http.Middleware({
-     before_request: [ SomethingC ],
-     after_request: [ SomethingD ],
-   })
    public GET() {
      ...
      ...
      ...
    }
  }
```

If you have any custom middleware that you have plugged into your Drash
application, they must be converted to the new `Drash.Services` syntax. To learn
more about creating services, read
[Tutorials > Services > Creating Services](/drash/v2.x/tutorials/services/creating-services/introduction).

To learn more about resource-level services, see
[Tutorials > Services > Adding Resource-Level Services](/drash/v2.x/tutorials/services/adding-resource-level-services).

## Example Application

### Code

The below example application contains the following:

- A resource (`HomeResource`) that handles `GET` and `POST` requests
- A resource (`ServicesResource`) that handles `GET` and `POST` requests
  - This resource has a service that executes on all requests
  - This resource also has a service that executes only on `POST` requests
- A server with a service that executes on all requests

```typescript
// app.ts

// Replace `<VERSION>` with the Drash v2.x version you want to use.
// All versions can be found at https://github.com/drashland/drash/releases?q=v2&expanded=trueh.
import * as Drash from "http://deno.land/x/drash@<VERSION>/mod.ts";
