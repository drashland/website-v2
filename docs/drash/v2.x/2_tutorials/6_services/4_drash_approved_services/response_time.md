# Response Time

This service was introduced in v2.2.0. Please make sure you are using v2.2.0 (or
higher) before proceeding with this tutorial.

This service will record how long a response takes for any given request, by
setting a `X-Response-Time` header on the response.

Simply add it to your Drash server's `services` config and you are all set!

## Before You Get Started

To use this service, edit your `deps.ts` file to include the service.

```typescript
// deps.ts

...
...
...
export { ResponseTimeService } from "https://deno.land/x/drash@<VERSION>/src/services/response_time/response_time.ts";
```

Replace `<VERSION>` with the latest version of **Drash v2.x**. The latest
version can be found [here](https://github.com/drashland/drash/releases/latest).

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app.ts` file.

```typescript
// app.ts

import { Drash, ResponseTimeService } from "./deps.ts";

// Create your resource

class HomeResource extends Drash.Resource {
  public paths = ["/"];

  public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
    return response.text("Hello, world!");
  }
}

// Create and run your server (with ResponseTimeServer instantiated)

const server = new Drash.Server({
  hostname: "localhost",
  port: 1447,
  protocol: "http",
  resources: [
    HomeResource,
  ],
  services: [
    new ResponseTimeService(),
  ],
});

server.run();

console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}.`);
```

## Verification

1. Run your app.

```shell
$ deno run --allow-net app.ts
```

2. Using `curl` (or similar command), make a `GET` request to
   `http://localhost:1447`.

```shell
$ curl -v http://localhost:1447
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

```text
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connection failed
* connect to ::1 port 1447 failed: Connection refused
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 1447 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:1447
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< content-type: text/plain
< x-response-time: 5ms
< content-length: 13
< date: Wed, 20 Oct 2021 02:20:33 GMT
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello, world!* Closing connection 0
```

As you can see, the response contains the following header:

```text
< x-response-time: 5ms
```
