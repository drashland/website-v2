## Before You Get Started

In this tutorial, you will create a very basic HTTP server that handles some
common requests: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app.ts` file. Your resource in this file will be able to handle
   `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests at the `/` URI.

   ```typescript
   // app.ts

   import { Drash } from "./deps.ts";

   // Create your resource

   class HomeResource extends Drash.Resource {
     public paths = ["/"];

     public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       return response.text("GET request received!");
     }

     public POST(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       return response.text("POST request received!");
     }

     public PUT(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       return response.text("PUT request received!");
     }

     public DELETE(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       return response.text("DELETE request received!");
     }
   }

   // Create and run your server

   const server = new Drash.Server({
     hostname: "localhost",
     port: 1447,
     protocol: "http",
     resources: [
       HomeResource,
     ],
   });

   server.run();

   console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}.`);
   ```

## Verification

1. Run your app.

   ```shell
   $ deno run --allow-net app.ts
   ```

2. Go to `http://localhost:1447` in your web browser. You should receive the
   following response:

   ```text
   GET request received!
   ```

3. Try some other requests using `curl` (or similar command):

- `$ curl -X POST http://localhost:1447`
  - Returns `POST request received!`
- `$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:1447`
  - Returns `PUT request received!`
- `$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:1447`
  - Returns `DELETE request received!`
