# Adding HTTP Methods

Giving a resource the ability to handle different types of requests is as easy
as adding the HTTP method to handle those requests. In the code below, the
resource can handle `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.

The HTTP methods you add in a resource are the request methods clients are
allowed to perform. If a client tries to perform a `PATCH` request to the below
resource, the client will receive a `405 Method Not Allowed` error because the
resource does not have a `PATCH` method defined.

```typescript
// home_resource.ts

// @Import drash

export default class HomeResource extends Drash.Resource {
  public paths = ["/"];

  public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
    return response.json({ hello: "GET" });
  }

  public POST(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
    return response.json({ hello: "POST" });
  }

  public PUT(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
    return response.json({ hello: "PUT" });
  }

  public DELETE(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
    return response.json({ hello: "DELETE" });
  }
}
```

Resources can handle the following HTTP verbs as methods:

- `GET`
- `HEAD`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`
- `CONNECT`
- `OPTIONS`
- `TRACE`
- `PATCH`

Taking the above example code, you can add more HTTP methods by following the
below syntax and replacing `{HTTP VERB}` with the HTTP verb you want to add:

```typescript
public {HTTP VERB}(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void { ... }
```
