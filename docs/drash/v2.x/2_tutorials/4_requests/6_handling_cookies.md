## Before You Get Started

Getting a cookie from a request can be done using the following in a resource:

```typescript
const cookieValue = request.getCookie("my_cookie");
```

In this tutorial, you will learn how to get cookies from a request and parse
them into a key-value pair object.

Drash uses Deno Standard Modules for cookie handling.

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app.ts` file. Your resource in this file will get the
   `my_cookie` value and use it in the response body.

   ```typescript
   import { Drash } from "./deps.ts";

   // Create your resource

   class HomeResource extends Drash.Resource {
     public paths = ["/"];

     public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       const cookieValue = request.getCookie("my_cookie");

       if (cookieValue) {
         return response.text(
           `You passed in the following cookie value: ${cookieValue}`,
         );
       }

       return response.text(`No cookie value received.`);
     }
   }

   // Create and run your server

   const server = new Drash.Server({
     hostname: "0.0.0.0",
     port: 1447,
     protocol: "http",
     resources: [
       HomeResource,
     ],
   });

   server.run();

   console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}.`);
   ```

## Verification

1. Run your app.

   ```shell
   $ deno run --allow-net app.ts
   ```

2. Using `curl` (or similar command), make a `GET` request to
   `http://localhost:1447` and pass the following cookie key-value pair:
   `my_cookie=chocolate`.

   ```shell
   $ curl --cookie my_cookie=chocolate http://localhost:1447
   ```

   You should receive the following response:

   ```text
   You passed in the following cookie value: chocolate
   ```
