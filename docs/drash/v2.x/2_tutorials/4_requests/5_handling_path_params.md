## Before You Get Started

You can get a value from a request's path params by using the following in a
resource:

```typescript
const param = request.pathParam("param_name");
```

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app.ts` file. Your resource in this file will check for the
   `:id` path param in the request's URL. If it exists and is a `number`, then
   it will return what was passed in. If it is `NaN`, then it will throw a
   `400 Bad Request` response.

   ```typescript
   // app.ts

   import { Drash } from "./deps.ts";

   // Create your resource

   class UsersResource extends Drash.Resource {
     public paths = ["/users/:id"];

     public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       // Check for the param
       const userId = parseInt(request.pathParam("id"));

       // Param is not a number? Get out.
       if (isNaN(userId)) {
         throw new Drash.Errors.HttpError(
           400,
           "This resource requires the `:id` path param to be a number.",
         );
       }

       return response.text(
         `You passed in the following user ID as the path param: ${userId}`,
       );
     }
   }

   // Create and run your server

   const server = new Drash.Server({
     hostname: "localhost",
     port: 1447,
     protocol: "http",
     resources: [
       UsersResource,
     ],
   });

   server.run();

   console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}.`);
   ```

## Verification

1. Run your app.

   ```shell
   $ deno run --allow-net app.ts
   ```

2. Using `curl` (or similar command), make a `GET` request to
   `http://localhost:1447/users/1`.

   ```text
   $ curl http://localhost:1447/users/1
   ```

   You should receive the following response:

   ```text
   You passed in the following user ID as the path param: 1
   ```

3. Make the same request, but change the `:id` path param to `one`.

   ```text
   $ curl http://localhost:1447/users/one
   ```

   You should receive the following response:

   ```text
   This resource requires the `:id` path param to be a number.
   ```

## Further Reading

The above tutorial exercises a required param. If you want to test out using an
optional param, then change your `app.ts` file to the following ...

```typescript
// app.ts

import { Drash } from "./deps.ts";

// Create your resource

class UsersResource extends Drash.Resource {
  public paths = ["/users/:id?"];

  public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
    // Check for the param
    const param = request.pathParam("id");

    if (param) {
      const userId = parseInt(param);

      // Param is not a number? Get out.
      if (isNaN(userId)) {
        throw new Drash.Errors.HttpError(
          400,
          "The 'id' path param must be a number.",
        );
      }
      return response.text(
        `You passed in the following user ID as the path param: ${userId}`,
      );
    }

    return response.text(`No param pased in! That's ok though. It's optional.`);
  }
}

// Create and run your server

const server = new Drash.Server({
  hostname: "localhost",
  port: 1447,
  protocol: "http",
  resources: [
    UsersResource,
  ],
});

server.run();

console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}.`);
```

... and make the following requests ...

- `$ curl http://localhost:1447/users`
  - Returns `No param pased in! That's ok though. It's optional.`
- `$ curl http://localhost:1447/users/1`
  - Returns `You passed in the following user ID as the path param: 1`
- `$ curl http://localhost:1447/users/three`
  - Returns `Error: The 'id' path param must be a number.`
