# About the Tutorials

The tutorials in the sidebar are ordered (from top to bottom) in a way that will
help you understand how you would start using Vital, as an introduction to it.
Since all tutorials have example code of setting up a model, it is not required
that you read the tutorials in order. However, it is greatly recommended.

Most tutorials will follow the format below:

**Before You Get Started**

- This section has key things we feel you should know before you get started
  with the tutorial.

**Folder Structure End State**

- This is what your project should look like at the end of the tutorial.

**Steps**

- A list of steps to get you from start to finish -- meeting the Folder
  Structure End State with a small, working application.

**Verification**

- After you follow the Steps section, you can use this Verification section to
  test that your application is working.
