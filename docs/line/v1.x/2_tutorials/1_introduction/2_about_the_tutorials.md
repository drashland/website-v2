# About the Tutorials

The tutorials in the sidebar are ordered (from top to bottom) in a way that will
help you understand how to create a single command CLI and a subcommand CLI.

All of the information regarding main commands, subcommands, adding arguments,
and adding options come after the CLI-creation tutorials. Reason being we want
you to build a CLI first and get into the nuances of the framework later.
However, the choice is always yours!

Most tutorials will follow the format below:

**Before You Get Started**

- This section has key things we feel you should know before you get started
  with the tutorial.

**Folder Structure End State**

- This is what your project should look like at the end of the tutorial.

**Steps**

- A list of steps to get you from start to finish -- meeting the Folder
  Structure End State with a small, working application.

**Verification**

- After you follow the Steps section, you can use this Verification section to
  test that your application is working.

If at any time you get confused and the documentation is not helping you, hit us

provide you with guidance!
