## Before You Get Started

`Page` provides methods to wait in specific scenarios, such as waiting for the
page to change after clicking a button, or waiting for an anchor change on the
URI. These help in ensuring your following code matches what the page should be.
So say for example, you click a button that changes the page after 5 seconds.
The `waitForPageChange()` method will wait for this, so your other actions and
assertions are not trying to run whilst the new page has not loaded yet.

The following methods Sinco provides are:

- `waitForPageChange()`
  - The `waitForPageChange()` method will wait for the page to change, eg
    clicking an anchor tag that directs the user to a new uri.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Create a headless browser instance;
- Go to a website; and
- Wait for the page to change on a click.

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app_test.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app_test.ts` file.

   ```typescript
   // app_test.ts

   import { buildFor } from "./deps.ts";

   Deno.test("My web app works as expected", async function () {
     const Sinco = await buildFor("chrome");
     const page = await Sinco.goTo("https://drash.land");
     const element = await page.querySelector(
       'a[href="https://discord.gg/UuYKTVMW"]',
     );
     await element.click();
     await page.waitForPageChange();
     const location = await page.location();
     await Sinco.done();
     assertEquals(location, "https://discord.com/invite/UuYKTVMW");
   });
   ```

Here you are going to create your headless browser instance, and navigate to
`https://drash.land`. Once the page has loaded, you will select an element on
the page and click it -- waiting for the new page to load before proceeding.
Finally you will assert that clicking has worked and the URL is now different.

## Verification

1. Run your test.

   ```shell
   $ deno test --allow-run --allow-read --allow-net app_test.ts
   ```

2. All of your tests should pass.
