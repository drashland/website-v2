## Before You Get Started

`Page` provides some utility methods that act as wrappers for Deno's std/testing
assertions. These methods will run a query on the DOM and make an assertion. You
do not need to assert these yourself.

The method it provides is:

- `assertSee` - This method will assert that the given text exists inside the
  page

In this tutorial, you will:

- Create a headless browser instance; and
- Assert text exists inside the DOM (page).

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app_test.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app_test.ts` file.

   ```typescript
   // app_test.ts

   import { buildFor } from "./deps.ts";

   Deno.test("My web app works as expected", async () => {
     const Sinco = await buildFor("chrome");
     const page = await Sinco.goTo("https://drash.land");
     await page.assertSee("Develop With Confidence");
     await Sinco.done();
   });
   ```

Here you are going to create your headless browser instance, and navigate to
`https://drash.land`. Once the page has loaded, you will assert that you can see
some given text on the page, and in this example, it is
`Develop With Confidence`.

## Verification

1. Run your test.

   ```shell
   $ deno test --allow-run --allow-read --allow-net app_test.ts
   ```

2. All of your tests should pass.
