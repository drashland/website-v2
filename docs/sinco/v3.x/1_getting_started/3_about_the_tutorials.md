# About the Tutorials

Most tutorials will follow the format below:

**Before You Get Started**

- This section has key things we feel you should know before you get started
  with the tutorial.

**Folder Structure End State**

- This is what your project should look like at the end of the tutorial.

**Steps**

- A list of steps to get you from start to finish -- meeting the Folder
  Structure End State.

**Folder Structure End State**

- This is what your project should look like at the end of the tutorial.

**Verification**

- After you follow the Steps section, you can use this Verification section to
  test that your application is working.

- Most, if not all verification steps will mention to test a file. You should
  note that the commands these use do not restrict permissions, but it is
  recommended that you do. The reason they don't is because what Sinco needs
  access to is very dynamic, and very dependant on which OS and browser you are
  using. You should refer to
  [restricting permissions](https://drash.land/sinco/v3.x/tutorials/restricting-permissions)
  for more information on how you may do this. But we do suggest that when you
  start using Sinco in your project, you make the restrictions so you know
  exactly what Sinco can and can't do.
