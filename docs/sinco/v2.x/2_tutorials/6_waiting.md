## Before You Get Started

Sinco provides methods to wait in specific scenarios, such as waiting for the
page to change after clicking a button, or waiting for an anchor change on the
uri. These help in ensuring your following code matches what the page should be,
so say for example, you click a button that changes the page after 5 seconds.
The `waitForPageChange()` method will wait for this, so your other actions and
assertions aren't trying to run whilst the new page hasn't loaded yet.

The following methods Sinco provides are:

- `waitForPageChange()`
- The `waitForPageChange()` method will wait for the page to change, eg clicking
  an anchor tag that directs the user to a new uri.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Create a headless browser instance; and
- Go to a website;
- Wait for the page to change on a click.

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app_test.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app_test.ts` file.

   ```typescript
   // app_test.ts

   import { buildFor } from "./deps.ts";

   Deno.test("My web app works as expected", async function () {
     const Sinco = await buildFor("chrome");
     await Sinco.goTo("https://drash.land");
     await Sinco.assertUrlIs("https://drash.land/");
     await Sinco.click('a[href="https://discord.gg/UuYKTVMW"]');
     await Sinco.waitForPageChange();
     await Sinco.assertUrlIs("https://discord.com/invite/UuYKTVMW");
     await Sinco.done();
   });
   ```

Here you are going to create your headless browser instance, and navigate to
https://drash.land. Once the page has loaded, you will assert that the url for
the page is as expected.

## Verification

1. Run your test.

   ```shell
   $ deno test --allow-run --allow-read --allow-net app_test.ts
   ```

2. All of your tests should pass
