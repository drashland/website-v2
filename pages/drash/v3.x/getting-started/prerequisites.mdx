# Prerequisites

<Callout type="info" emoji={null}>
You can skip to the [Next Steps](#next-steps) at the bottom of this page or you can skip this page entirely if you already have a JavaScript runtime installed and have an HTTP server set up in that runtime.
</Callout>

## 1. Choose a Runtime

You will need to choose a JavaScript runtime that:

1. fits your use case(s); and
1. provides APIs to create an HTTP server (e.g., `http.createServer(...)` in Node).

## 2. Install the Runtime

After choosing your runtime, you will need to install it. You can do this by following your runtime's documentation pages (typically under an "installation" or similar page).

## 3. Create an HTTP Server

Assuming your runtime provides APIs to create an HTTP server, follow your runtime's documentation pages on creating one. Once you have your HTTP server set up, head back to this page and check out the [Next Steps](#next-steps) below.

<Callout type="info" emoji={null}>
Drash v3.x doesn't provide APIs to create servers like what we did in [v2.x](/drash/v2.x/tutorials/servers/creating-a-server). Sorry!
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Feel free to follow our recommendation or navigate the documentation pages at your leisure.

### Our Recommendations

- Start [creating a `RequestChain`](../chains/request-chain/create-the-chain) application
