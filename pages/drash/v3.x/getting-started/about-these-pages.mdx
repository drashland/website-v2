# About These Pages

## Assumptions

Most of these pages (especially those with a __Steps__ section) will assume:

1. you have a JavaScript runtime installed (as stated on the [Prerequisites](./prerequisites) page); and
1. you are building HTTP applications.

Drash has zero dependencies which means you could run it in the browser, but these documentation pages are written assuming you're using Drash to build HTTP applications.

## Recommended Reading

Some pages will recommend that you read the pages under the __Concepts__ section in the left sidebar. Those pages go over:

- a breakdown of the [framework](../concepts/framework);
- how [chains](../concepts/chains) (used to build HTTP applications) work under the hood;
- how [resources](../concepts/resources) play a role in the chains; and
- [default errors](../concepts/errors) thrown by the chains.

## Page Order

The pages in the sidebar are ordered (from top to bottom) in a way that we feel will help you:

1. start building applications quickly; and
1. understand the code you are writing/using.

It is not required that you read the pages in order, but we greatly recommend it for the reasons stated above.

## Tutorial Format

These pages have tutorials that typically contain a __Steps__ section that you can follow. These tutorial pages will follow the format below.

<div className="nx-border nx-rounded mt-5 p-5">

__Before You Get Started__

This section will include any prerequisite reading we feel you should do before following the tutorial. It will also include a high-level overview of what the tutorial teaches and the knowledge and confidence we hope you will gain after you complete the tutorial.

__Steps__

This section contains a list of steps that help you build a tiny HTTP application from scratch. Think of these steps as step-by-step instructions in a project. It will provide:

- the end state of the project's directory structure;
- example code (for different runtimes);
- comments in the code to explain what the code means

__Verification__

This section will include steps to help you verify the code you wrote is working.

<Callout type="info" emoji={null}>
This section will mention running your code, but you will have to refer to your chosen runtime's documentation pages on running your code.
</Callout>

__Next Steps__

This is the last section of the page. It will include our recommendations on what you could do next.

## Glossary

View the [Misc > Glossary](../misc/glossary) page (inspired by [MDN Web Docs Glossary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary)) for definitions of the terms and acronyms we use.

<Callout type="info" emoji={null}>
All of the terms and acronyms we use are used in the context of Drash unless otherwise stated.
</Callout>

We strive to prevent ambiguity in our writing as much as possible. We want you to be able to understand the code you're using so you can develop with confidence. However, we don't always get it right (Sorry!). If our writing isn't clear, has typos, could be improved, etc., please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/drashland/website-v2/issues). We appreciate help in making these pages better for all!


## Next Steps

Feel free to follow our recommendation, jump ahead, or navigate the documentation pages at your leisure. on your own.

### Our Recommendations

- Set up your local environment with the [prerequisites](./prerequisites).
