# Glossary

## Terms

The terms below are used ___in the context of Drash___. We know some terms may be used widely outside of Drash, so we have defined them here to help prevent ambiguity. For example, "runtime" is used in Java Runtime Environment, Red Hat Runtimes, and Node. However, ___in the context of Drash___, runtime refers to JavaScript runtimes: Deno, Node, or Bun.

### Client

Any "thing" that makes a request to your resources:

<SeeAlso items={{
  "resource": "Resource",
  "chain": "Chain"
}}/>

### Chain

See [Concepts > Chains - What Is a Chain?](/drash/v3.x/concepts/chains).

<SeeAlso items={{
  "handler": "Handler",
}}/>

### Directory

This is an alias for "folder", but we like to use "directory" instead of "folder" in our instructions.

### Environment

All of the things included to write and/or run your code. For example, this includes the computer you're using to write your code (aka your machine) and the runtime you're using to run your code. It could also include your [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Anything you are using write and/or run your code is your environment.

  "machine": "Machine"
}}/>

### Handler

A class with a `handle(input: Input): Output` method. Handlers are part of a chain. Their job is to process HTTP requests.

They look like the following:

```ts
// Typically, concrete handler classes extend an abstract handler class. It
// looks like this:

abstract class AbstractHandler<Input, Output> implements IHandler<Input, Output> {
  next_handler: IHandler<Input, Output> | null = null;

  abstract handle(input: Input): Output;
}

// When a concrete handler class is defined, it implements the `handle` method
// like this:

class BeItKnownThisIsMyHandler extends AbstractHandler<Request, Response> {
  handle(request: Request): Response {
    if (request.method === "GET") {
      return new Response("Got.");
    }

    return new Response("Not got.");
  }
}
```


<SeeAlso items={{
  "chain": "Chain",
}}/>

### Inputs

The data passed to each handler in a chain to help it produce an output.


<SeeAlso items={{
  "handler": "Handler",
  "chain": "Chain",
  "outputs": "Outputs"
}}/>

### Local Environment

The machine you're using to build with Drash. This could be the computer you're using right now.

<SeeAlso items={{
  "machine": "Machine",
  "environment": "Environment"
}}/>

### Machine

The computer you're using to build your Drash application.

### Outputs

The data returned from each handler in a chain in response to an input.


<SeeAlso items={{
  "chain": "Chain",
  "inputs": "Inputs",
  "handler": "Handler"
}}/>

### Paths

The paths defined in a resource class' `paths` property. These paths have the same definition as the [`URL.pathname`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname) property. For example:

```ts {2-4}
class MyResource {
  public paths = [
    "/teas",
  ];

  // ...
  // ... rest of the resource class implementation (code is shortened for brevity)
  // ...
}
```

### Request

This is an alias for <LinkExternal href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_requests">HTTP Request</LinkExternal>.

### Resource

See [Concepts > Resources - What Is a Resource](/drash/v3.x/concepts/resources#what-is-a-resource).

### Runtime

Runtime refers to a JavaScript runtime like Deno, Node, or Bun.

## Acronyms

We try to write these documentation pages briefly and clearly. However, it can get repetitive to write the same words over and over when a well-known acronym exists for them. If you see acronyms, you can find their definitions here.

### CJS

[CommonJS Module](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules)

When this is used in the context of an example code block tab, CJS means the example code below is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) using Drash as a CommonJS Module.

__Example__

<Tabs items={["CJS", "AnotherTab"]}>
<Tab>
```ts
// ... some CJS code block
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```ts
// ... some AnotherTab code block
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### ESM

ECMAScript Module

### JS

JavaScript

### JS ESM

These two acronyms are usually applied to example code block tabs. It means, "The example code for this tab is written in JavaScript using Drash as an ECMAScript Module."

__Example__

<Tabs items={["JS ESM", "AnotherTab"]}>
<Tab>
```ts
// ... some JS ESM code block
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```ts
// ... some AnotherTab code block
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### TLDR

This is a variant of <LinkExternal href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR">TL;DR</LinkExternal>, but without the semicolon.

### TS

TypeScript

### TS ESM

These two acronyms are usually applied to example code block tabs. It means, "The example code for this tab is written in TypeScript using Drash as an ECMAScript Module."

__Example__

<Tabs items={["TS ESM", "AnotherTab"]}>
<Tab>
```ts
// ... some TS ESM code block
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```ts
// ... some AnotherTab code block
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
