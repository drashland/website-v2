## Before You Get Started

_Disclaimer: The service shown in this tutorial is just a proof of concept. You
should not use this service in a production environment. It is not secure._

This tutorial goes over creating a resource-level service that runs before a
resource for requests only to a specific resource.

Specifically, it will show you how you can create an authentication service
proof of concept for a single resource. You will create two resources:

1. A resource that applies the authentication service; and
2. A resource that does not apply the authentication service.

Since this tutorial goes over a resource-level service, you will not use the
`services` config when creating your server. Instead, you will use the `ALL`
field in the `services` property in the resource that uses the service.

## Steps

1. {{ placeholder: drash_create_deps_file_step }}

1. Create your `app.ts` file.

   ```typescript
   // File: app.ts

   import { Drash } from "./deps.ts";
   import AuthResource from "./resources/auth_resource.ts";
   import NonAuthResource from "./resources/non_auth_resource.ts";

   const server = new Drash.Server({
     resources: [
       AuthResource,
       NonAuthResource,
     ],
     hostname: "localhost",
     port: 1447,
     protocol: "http",
   });

   // Run your server

   server.run();

   console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}`);
   ```

1. Create your `services/authentication_service.ts` file.

   The service in this file will be in charge of making sure all requests to
   `AuthResource` have the `username` and `token` query parameters; and they
   must match the ones defined in the `#users` property.

   ```typescript
   // File: services/authentication_service.ts

   import { Drash } from "../deps.ts";

   class AuthenticationService extends Drash.Service {
     /**
      * Map to hold usernames and tokens.
      */
     #users = new Map<string, string>([
       ["user_1", "token_1"],
       ["user_2", "token_2"],
     ]);

     /**
      * Run the following code before a resource is hit.
      *
      * @param request - The incoming request from the client.
      * @param response - The response to send back to the client (if needed).
      */
     public runBeforeResource(
       request: Drash.Request,
       response: Drash.Response,
     ): void {
       const username = request.queryParam("username");
       if (!username) {
         throw new Drash.Errors.HttpError(
           401,
           "You are not authorized! Username not provided.",
         );
       }

       const providedToken = request.queryParam("token");
       if (!providedToken) {
         throw new Drash.Errors.HttpError(
           401,
           "You are not authorized! Token not provided.",
         );
       }

       const token = this.#users.get(username);

       // End the lifecycle if the authentication requirements have not been met
       if (token !== providedToken) {
         throw new Drash.Errors.HttpError(
           401,
           "You are not authorized! Invalid credentials.",
         );
       }
     }
   }

   export default new AuthenticationService();
   ```

1. Create your `resources/auth_resource.ts` file.

   The resource in this file will be protected by the `AuthenticationService`
   class. Since the `AuthenticationService` class will be applied to this
   resource, any request to this resource should not see the response from this
   resource unless the request meets all of the `AuthenticationService` class'
   requirements (requires a `username` and `token`).

   ```typescript
   // File: resources/auth_resource.ts

   import { Drash } from "../deps.ts";
   import authenticationService from "../services/authentication_service.ts";

   export default class AuthResource extends Drash.Resource {
     public paths = ["/auth"];

     public services = {
       // For all requests, run the authentication service
       ALL: [authenticationService],
     };

     /**
      * Handle GET requests.
      *
      * @param request - The incoming request from the client.
      * @param response - The response to send back to the client.
      */
     public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       return response.text("You successfully authenticated!");
     }
   }
   ```

1. Create your `resources/non_auth_resource.ts` file.

   The resource in this file will not be protected by the
   `AuthenticationService` class. Therefore, requests will not require a
   `username` and `token` to get a response from this resource.

   ```typescript
   // File: resources/non_auth_resource.ts

   import { Drash } from "../deps.ts";

   export default class NonAuthResource extends Drash.Resource {
     public paths = ["/non-auth"];

     /**
      * Handle GET requests.
      *
      * @param request - The incoming request from the client.
      * @param response - The response to send back to the client.
      */
     public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
       return response.text(
         "Hello! You do not need a username and password to view this resource.",
       );
     }
   }
   ```

## Verification

1. Run your app.

   ```typescript
   $ deno run --allow-net app.ts
   ```

2. Using `curl` (or similar command), make a `GET` request to
   `http://localhost:1447/non-auth`.

   ```text
   $ curl http://localhost:1447/non-auth
   ```

   Since this resource is not using the `AuthenticationService` class, you
   should receive the following response:

   ```text
   Hello! You do not need a username and password to view this resource.
   ```

3. Make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:1447/auth`.

   ```text
   $ curl http://localhost:1447/auth
   ```

   Since this resource is using the `AuthenticationService` class for all
   requests, you should receive the following error message:

   ```text
   Error: You are not authorized! Username not provided.
   ```

4. Make the same request, but add the `username` query parameter with `user_1`
   as the value.

   ```text
   $ curl http://localhost:1447/auth?username=user_1
   ```

   You should receive the following error message:

   ```text
   Error: You are not authorized! Token not provided.
   ```

5. Make the same request, but add the `token` query parameter with `token_1` as
   the value.

   ```text
   $ curl "http://localhost:1447/auth?username=user_1&token=token_1"
   ```

   _You may need to wrap the URL in quotes to prevent `&` from starting a
   background process._

   You should receive the following message from `AuthResource`:

   ```text
   You successfully authenticated!
   ```

   As you can see, the request met all requirements in the
   `AuthenticationService` class, so the `AuthenticationService` class allowed
   the request to go through.

6. Make the same request, but change the token value to exercise a token
   mismatch.

   ```text
   $ curl "http://localhost:1447/auth?username=user_1&token=token_2"
   ```

   _You may need to wrap the URL in quotes to prevent `&` from starting a
   background process._

   You should receive the following error message:

   ```text
   Error: You are not authorized! Invalid credentials.
   ```

The above verification steps show the error stack strace. This is the default
behavior in Drash. If you want to learn more about handling errors, read
