# Dynamic Paths

Just like other frameworks, Drash resources have the ability to parse paths like the following:

- `/path/:id`
- `/path/:id?`
- `/[a-z]/[0-9]`

## Regular Path Params

Resources are able to specify path params in their paths to allow them to cover multiple endpoints. For example:

```typescript filename="ResourceWithPathParam.ts"
import { Resource } from "https://esm.sh/@drashland/drash@v3.0.0-beta.01/esm/modules/RequestChain/mod.native.ts"

class ResourceWithPathParam extends Resource {

  public paths = [
    "/:my_param",
  ];

  public GET(request: Request) {

    const param = request.params.pathParam("my_param");

    return new Response(`You passed in: ${param}`);
  }
}
```

Examples of requests that this resource would handle and the responses they would receive are:

```
Requests            Responses
 
GET /hello      ->  You passed in: hello
GET /world      ->  You passed in: world
GET /something  ->  You passed in: something
```

To learn more about handling path params, view the [Requests > Path Params](/drash-v3.x/modules/chains/request-chain/requests/path-params) page.

## Optional Path Params

Path params can also be optional using a question mark (`?`). This allows a resource to accept a request with a URI that does or does not have the path param. For example:

```typescript filename="Users.ts"
import { Resource } from "https://esm.sh/@drashland/drash@v3.0.0-beta.01/esm/modules/RequestChain/mod.native.ts"

class Users extends Resource {
  // id   = required
  // name = optional because of the trailing question mark
  // age  = optional because of the trailing question mark
  // city = optional because of the trailing question mark
  public paths = [
    "/users/:id/:name?/:age?/:city?",
  ];

  public GET(request: Request) {
    let body = "GOT";

    const id = request.params.pathParam("id");
    const name = request.params.pathParam("name");
    const age = request.params.pathParam("age");
    const city = request.params.pathParam("city");

    if (id) {
      body += ` | ${id}`;
    }

    if (name) {
      body += ` | ${name}`;
    }

    if (age) {
      body += ` | ${age}`;
    }

    if (city) {
      body += ` | ${city}`;
    }

    return new Response(body);
  }
}
```

You can have as many optional params as you wish, but required params ___MUST COME BEFORE___ optional params (notice how the `id` param is required and comes ___before___ the optional params).


Examples of requests that this resource would handle and the responses they would receive are:

```
Requests                       Responses
 
GET /users/1               ->  GOT | 1
GET /users/1/              ->  GOT | 1
GET /users/1/John          ->  GOT | 1 | John
GET /users/1/John/         ->  GOT | 1 | John
GET /users/1/John/54       ->  GOT | 1 | John | 54
GET /users/1/John/54/      ->  GOT | 1 | John | 54
GET /users/1/John/54/UK    ->  GOT | 1 | John | 54 | UK
GET /users/1/John/54/UK/   ->  GOT | 1 | John | 54 | UK
```

## Regular Expression Paths

Resources are able to specify regular expressions in their paths to allow them to cover multiple endpoints.

```typescript filename="RegexPathResource.ts"
import { Resource } from "https://esm.sh/@drashland/drash@v3.0.0-beta.01/esm/modules/RequestChain/mod.native.ts"

class RegexPathResource extends Resource {
  public paths = [
    "/([0-9]$)",
  ];

  public GET(request: Request) {
    return new Response("GOT!");
  }
}
```

Examples of requests that this resource would handle and the responses they would receive are:

```
Requests    Responses
 
GET /1  ->  GOT!
GET /2  ->  GOT!
GET /3  ->  GOT!
GET /9  ->  GOT!
```

This resource would not handle the following requests because they do not match the regular expression:

```
GET /11
GET /12
GET /13
GET /99
```
