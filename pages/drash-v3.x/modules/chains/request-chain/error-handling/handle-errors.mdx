# Handle Errors

Apologies! We are still working on this page!

We published this Work in Progress (WIP) page to make you are aware that this page is in the works. We hope to have this page written soon, so please check back later!

{/* ## Before You Get Started

In this tutorial, we will show you how to throw `HTTPError` objects, catch them, and use them to build responses. We will use the Request Chain module to build the application that throws the `HTTPError` object.

### Recommended Reading

- Read the [Introduction](/drash-v3.x/modules/chains/request-chain) on the Request Chain
- Read the [Introduction](/drash-v3.x/modules/chains/request-chain/error-handling/introduction) page on errors

### Objectives

To gain familiarity with:

- Drash's `HTTPError` class; and
- catching/throwing errors.
