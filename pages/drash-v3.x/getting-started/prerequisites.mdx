# Prerequisites

<Callout type="info" emoji={null}>
You can skip to the [Next Steps](#next-steps) at the bottom of this page or you can skip this page entirely if you already have a JavaScript runtime installed and have an HTTP server set up in that runtime.
</Callout>

## 1. Choose a Runtime

You will need to choose a JavaScript runtime that:

1. fits your use case(s); and
1. provides APIs to create an HTTP server (e.g., `http.createServer(...)` in Node v18.x or `Deno.serve(...)` in Deno v1.37.x).

You could run Drash in the browser, but these documentation pages are written assuming you are using Drash to build server-side HTTP applications. Pages discussing how to build applications in the browser will be written at a later time.
</Callout>

## 2. Install the Runtime

After choosing a runtime, you will need to install it on your [machine](/drash-v3.x/misc/glossary#machine) (or the machine you plan to use). You can do this by following your chosen runtime's documentation pages (typically under an "installation" page or similar).

## 3. Create an HTTP Server

Once your chosen runtime is installed and ready to be used, follow its documentation pages on creating an HTTP server. When you have an HTTP server set up, head back to this page and check out the [Next Steps](#next-steps) below.

Unlike previous versions of Drash where Drash is a Deno HTTP server wrapper under the hood, Drash v3 is an agnostic codebase that can be used to create different types of functionality. This means __Drash v3 does not provide APIs to create HTTP servers__ like what we did in [v2.x](/drash/v2.x/tutorials/servers/creating-a-server). Sorry!
</Callout>

__What does creating an HTTP server mean?__

When we say "creating an HTTP server," we mean __writing some code that can listen for HTTP requests__. As an example, if you chose Deno v1.37.1 and wanted to create an HTTP server in it, that code could look like:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="app.ts"
Deno.serve({
    port: 1447,
    hostname: "localhost",
    handler: (request) => {
        console.log({ request });

        return new Response("Hello!");
    },
});
```

Taking this a step further, you could run the above code using:

```bash filename="Terminal"
deno run --allow-net app.ts
```

When the code is running (aka when the HTTP server is running), it would be listening for HTTP requests. This means if you go to `http://localhost:1447` in your browser (aka make an HTTP request to `http://localhost:1447`), then you would see `Hello!` on the page (because the request is handled with a `return new Response("Hello!")` in the code).
